:bulb: WeCheck is a rubric system for the critical evaluation of interfaces, this idea was developed by a research group from the [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/estudiar-online). Different evaluators can review web pages and score them using this system. The client needs a website where these rubrics can be entered, so that registered or unregistered users can evaluate websites and obtain a visual result of the evaluations, by evaluator and by average.
